        Research and Visualization System (ISERV) Level-0 Product\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese
        products were created at the ISERV Science Operation Center (SOC) at\nthe
        National Space Science and Technology Center.\n\nISERV is an automated system
        designed to acquire images of the Earth''s\nsurface from the International
        Space Station (ISS). It is primarily a means\nto gain experience and expertise
        in automated data acquisition from the ISS,\nalthough it is expected to provide
        useful images for use in disaster\nmonitoring and assessment, and environmental
        decision making.\n\nFor more information about ISERV:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/servir/index.html\n\nFor
        more information about SERVIR:\nhttp://servirglobal.net\n\n## Format\n\nISERV
        data is provided in JPEG format for Level 0 products. Level 0 is\ngeoreferenced
        using the following coordinate system:\n`WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere`\n\nGeoTIFFs
        are provided by ISERV. Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs are provided by\nRadiant Earth
        Foundation\n\n## Organization\n\nISERV is a true color image in JPEG format.
        Each band is delivered as a\ngrayscale, JPEG-compressed, 8-bit string of unsigned
        integers. Bands are not\ncalibrated. Accompanying each image is an XML auxiliary
        file, a JGW (\"world\")\nfile that provides image location and geometry information,
        and an OVR\noverview file containing the reduced resolution image pyramid
        for ease of use\nin image processing software.\n\n### Data File Names\n\nThe
        file naming convention for ISERV L-0 data is as follows:\n\n`IP0YYMMDDhhmmssLATLON.JPG`
        where:\n\n* `IP` - ISERV Pathfinder\n* `0` - Processing level\n* `YY` - two-numeral
        year\n* `MM` - two-numeral month\n* `DD` - two-numeral day\n* `hh` - two-numeral
        hour\n* `mm` - two-numeral minute\n* `ss` - two-numeral second\n* `LAT` -
        four-numeral latitude in decimal degrees plus hemispherical indicator\n  (`N`
        or `S`)\n* `LON` - five-numeral longitude in decimal degrees plus hemispherical\n  indicator
        (`E` or `W`)\n\nExample: `IP01306111234561234N12345W.jpg`\n\n`LON` is always
        5 characters -- 3 left of decimal, 2 right of decimal, plus a\ncardinal direction
        indicator\n\n`123.45W` (or `-123.45`) becomes `12345W`\n\n`23.45E` becomes
        `02345E`\n\n`5.5E` becomes `00550E`\n \n`LAT` is always 4 characters -- 2
        left of decimal, 2 right of decimal, plus a\ncardinal direction indicator\n\n`34.56S`
        (or `-34.56`) becomes `3456S`\n\n`4.56N` becomes `0456N`\n\n`6.6S` becomes
        `0660S`\n\n### READING DATA\n\nAny image display software can open the JPEG
        image files. \nNo software is included on this product for viewing ISERV data.\n\n##
        General Information and Documentation\n\n### ISERV data access\n\nUSGS EarthExplorer
        at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov\n\n### Data restrictions\n\nThis is an experimental
        product derived from the ISERV Pathfinder system.\nData and metadata files
        may be freely distributed without restriction.\n\n### Credits\n\nISERV, NASA\n\n###
        Level 0 Data Processing Levels\n\nReconstructed, unprocessed ISERV instrument
        data at full resolution in JPEG\nformat, with all communications artifacts
        (e.g., synchronization frames,\ncommunications headers, duplicate data) removed.
        Images are geolocated using\na custom-built, automated georeferencing process
        which provides an average\npositional accuracy of approximately 2km.\n\n##
